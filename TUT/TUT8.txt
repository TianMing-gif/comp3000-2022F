Part A:
1.	a. it create a file f1 with the urandom value
	b. -a flag is archive, special file?
	c. it seems did the same as b
	d. this cannot happen with a non-privileged user.
	e. mknod create a special or ordinary file
c for character device; 1 for major number the kernel to use; 9 is the minor number for internal usage
2. mkfifo file1; ls | wc;
3. no
4. they do not act the same. modern Linux systems the copy often doesn't behave like the original
5. 
disabling local echo using ---- stty -echo
restore local echo using ------ stty echo

Part B:
1. done
2. done. the kernel log is store at var/log/kern.log
3. use command lsmod you can see all the models
4. use insmod to load, use rmmod to remove the module from the kernel
5. trace command will trace a function and print its arguments or return value.
	it will use Linux eBPF

Part C:
1. done
2. it create a file that print infinite 1's
3. becaue the 1 it output are all at the same line, so head or tail is not work
	awk cut
4. remove the error handling part in ones module
5. 

Part D:
1. done 
2. Current is a global variable of type struct task_struct
	when the kernel is processing a system call, the task that made the system call is referred to as "current" 
3. at line 106, device is create with the device name as newgetpid
4. ppid, uid, gid, euid, egid
