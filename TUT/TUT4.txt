1. use 3000userlogin to login without password
use the root user
./3000userlogin other

2. passwd *getpwnam(const char *name)
   it returns pw_name, pw_passwd, pw_uid, pw_gid, pw_gecos, pw_dir, pw_shell

3. regular user:uid=1000, euid=1000, gid=1000, egid=1000, Failed to change to gid 1002
   setuid root: uid=1000, euid=0   , gid=1000, egid=1000 which will change
                                 ↓
                uid=1000, euid=0   , gid=1002, egid=1002
   root:        uid=0   , euid=0   , gid=0   , egid=0   
   
4.it might because if the uid changed first, it will become regular user later. If change pid now it will fail.

5. ./3000userlogin
            after: uid=1002, euid=1002, gid=1002, egid=1002
chsh replaces the shell /etc/passwd. 
The problem is /bin/bash is hardcoded. use pw_entry ( /bin/bash )
then chsh is used everytime

6. the change is adding bin/3000shell to the text. but the username is null ???
maybe change the env to USER will work

7.No, regular shell is not default. Yes it can be an arbitrary program.
/etc/shells should include the program if you want to use arbitrary program.

8.I think it is not important. After login there will be no new variables.

9. envp will not change by *env() ex.put or set..

10. |grep setgid ----> setgid(1002)
    |grep setuid ----> setuid(1002)

11. √
12. √
13. the files /etc checking by ls -l
        ↓
    error.log
    login via ssh: shell run first then the command
